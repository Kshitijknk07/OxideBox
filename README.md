# üß™ OxideBox

**OxideBox** is a command-line Pok√©mon container and battle simulator written in Rust. It lets you create, manage, and battle Pok√©mon, all with persistent storage using SQLite. Think of it as a blend of Pok√©mon and Docker‚ÄîPok√©mon are "containers" you can summon, pause, start, stop, and battle, all from your terminal.

---

## What Is This Project?

- **Pok√©mon as Containers:** Each Pok√©mon is managed like a container, with its own stats, moves, and state (Created, Running, Paused, Stopped).
- **Battle System:** Simulate turn-based Pok√©mon battles, including type effectiveness and move usage.
- **Persistent Storage:** All Pok√©mon and their stats are saved in a local SQLite database.
- **Namespaces:** Organize your Pok√©mon into different groups (namespaces) for better management.
- **Trainer Stats:** Track your overall progress, wins, losses, and more.

---

## Features

- **Create and manage Pok√©mon** with custom stats and up to 4 moves.
- **Battle** between any two "Running" Pok√©mon.
- **Save/load** Pok√©mon to/from the database.
- **View detailed stats** for both trainers and Pok√©mon.
- **Organize Pok√©mon** using namespaces.
- **Modern, colorful CLI output** for a fun experience.

## How To Use

### 1. **Build the Project**

```bash
cargo build --release
```

### 2. **Run Commands**

All commands are run with `cargo run -- <command> [args]`.

#### **Namespace Management**

- **Create a namespace:**
  ```bash
  cargo run -- create-namespace <name>
  ```
- **Delete a namespace:**
  ```bash
  cargo run -- delete-namespace <name>
  ```

#### **Pok√©mon Management**

- **Summon a Pok√©mon:**
  ```bash
  cargo run -- summon <namespace> <name> <level> <hp> <attack> <defense> <speed> <type>
  ```
  Example:
  ```bash
  cargo run -- summon myteam Pikachu 5 100 55 40 90 Electric
  ```

- **Start, Stop, Pause a Pok√©mon container:**
  ```bash
  cargo run -- start <id>
  cargo run -- stop <id>
  cargo run -- pause <id>
  ```

- **List all Pok√©mon (optionally by namespace):**
  ```bash
  cargo run -- list
  cargo run -- list <namespace>
  ```

- **View Pok√©mon status:**
  ```bash
  cargo run -- status <id>
  ```

#### **Battling**

- **Battle two Pok√©mon (both must be Running):**
  ```bash
  cargo run -- battle <id1> <id2>
  ```

#### **Persistence**

- **Save a Pok√©mon to the database:**
  ```bash
  cargo run -- save <id>
  ```
- **Load a Pok√©mon from the database:**
  ```bash
  cargo run -- load <id>
  ```

#### **Trainer Stats**

- **View your overall stats:**
  ```bash
  cargo run -- stats
  ```

## How Does It Work?

- **Pok√©mon are containers:** Each has stats, moves, and a state.
- **Namespaces:** Like folders for your Pok√©mon.
- **Battle system:** Turn-based, with random move selection and type effectiveness.
- **Database:** All data is stored in `pokemon.db` (SQLite).
- **Colorful output:** Uses the `colored` crate for a modern CLI feel.

## What‚Äôs Done (as of now)?

- [x] Pok√©mon container creation and management
- [x] Namespaces for organization
- [x] Persistent storage with SQLite
- [x] Turn-based battle system
- [x] Trainer and Pok√©mon stats tracking
- [x] Colorful, user-friendly CLI output
- [x] Save/load Pok√©mon
- [x] List and status commands

---

## What‚Äôs Not Done / Limitations

- No graphical UI (CLI only)
- No online multiplayer
- No real Pok√©mon sprites or sound
- Only basic move and type logic (not all Pok√©mon mechanics)

---

## Learning & Extending

- **To learn:** Read the code in `src/`‚Äîit‚Äôs modular and commented.
- **To extend:** Add new commands in `cli.rs` and `main.rs`. Add new Pok√©mon types or moves in `moves.rs`.
- **To reset:** Just delete `pokemon.db` to start fresh.

---

## Requirements

- Rust (latest stable)
- SQLite3 (for the database)

---

## Why?

This project is for learning Rust, database integration, and CLI design‚Äîwhile having fun with Pok√©mon concepts!
